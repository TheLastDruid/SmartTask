# Debug Functionality Test

## New Debug Panel Behavior

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - The WebSocket debug panel should be hidden by default
   - The "Live Updates" connection status indicator should be hidden by default
2. **Activation**: Double-clicking the SmartTask logo in the navbar should toggle both the debug panel and live updates indicator
3. **Panel Features**: 
   - Shows/hides WebSocket connection status
   - Displays live update information
   - Shows recent WebSocket messages
   - Includes test buttons for debugging
   - Has minimize/expand functionality
   - Has a close button (X) to hide the panel
4. **Live Updates Indicator**:
   - Shows connection status (Connected/Offline) with appropriate colors
   - Only visible when debug mode is active
   - Appears in the dashboard header next to the title

### Testing Steps:
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3000
2. Login with valid credentials
3. Verify that no debug panel is visible initially
4. **Verify that the "Live Updates" indicator is hidden by default**
5. Double-click the "SmartTask" logo in the top-left navbar
6. Verify that the debug panel appears in the bottom-right corner
7. **Verify that the "Live Updates" indicator appears in the dashboard header**
8. Test the minimize/expand functionality
9. Test the close button
10. Double-click the logo again to toggle both the panel and live updates indicator off/on

### Implementation Details:
- **Components Modified:**
  - `WebSocketDebugger.js`: Added `isVisible` and `onClose` props
  - `Navbar.js`: Added double-click handler to logo, added `onToggleDebugger` prop
  - `Dashboard.js`: Added `showDebugger` state and `toggleDebugger` function
  
- **Key Changes:**
  - Debug panel now controlled by state in Dashboard component
  - Logo has double-click event listener with visual feedback (cursor-pointer)
  - Debug panel only renders when `isVisible` is true
  - Live Updates indicator only shows when `showDebugger` state is true
  - Added close button to debug panel header
